## ℹ️ Developer Notes for Integration

- This is designed to be included as a **Claude system prompt** OR parsed into a **vectorized knowledge base**
- Recommend starting with this static format in sandbox/dev
- GitHub push should contain:
  - This file (e.g., `knowledge_base.md`)
  - Claude integration logic that references it during chat context loading
- For long-term production, move this into an automated or query-based format using a RAG pipeline (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) or live API hooks into Shopify
